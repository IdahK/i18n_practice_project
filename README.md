## Internalization

This is a Spring MVC Practice Project focusing on internalization (i18n) where we display local messages based on the selected **locale**. That is, en for English messages, fr for French etc.


**Internalization**, commonly referred to as i18n (number of letters between the first letter 'i' and 'n' is 18), is the process of designing and developing that can be adapted to different languages, regions and cultural settings.

By using internalization techniques, developers can create software applications that are **accessible** to a wider audience and meet the needs and expections of users in different countries  and that offer a **better localized user experience** for people who prefer to interact with the software in their native language.
